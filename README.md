README.md — Project: “LiveLearn AI”
An open-source AI-powered real-time interactive training environment for any software
________________________________________
🚀 Overview
LiveLearn AI is an open-source platform designed to revolutionise how people learn and teach software.
Instead of watching static tutorial videos or clicking through sandbox “try-it-yourself” interfaces, trainees experience a real, live, controllable training session — as if a human tutor is sitting beside them.
It is built to work with any software, from Microsoft Excel to AutoCAD, SCADA HMIs, or web-based CRMs — the system observes, records, replays, and teaches directly through the actual UI, not a simulated one.
The concept is simple but powerful:
“A digital tutor that performs live on your screen, shows where to click, explains why, and lets you take over anytime.”

🎯 Core Principles
•	Universal training — Works with any desktop or web software.
•	Real-time interactivity — Watch the tutor or take control instantly.
•	AI awareness — The tutor “sees” the screen and responds contextually.
•	Human realism — The AI moves the mouse, types, and interacts just like a human.
•	Autonomous feedback — At the end of a session, the system compares the user’s actions with the tutor’s and generates performance analytics.

🧩 Core Components
1. AI Playback Engine (Real-time Tutor)
•	Replays recorded sessions frame-by-frame with full cursor movement, typing, scrolling, and window control.
•	The tutor’s mouse and keyboard are visible in real time, mimicking human demonstration.
•	Allows partial playback (specific steps, sections, or error recovery).
2. Recorder (Universal Capture System)
•	Captures every user interaction:
o	Mouse movement and coordinates
o	Clicks, drags, scrolls
o	Keyboard input
o	Window and application context
o	On-screen elements (via computer vision)
•	Each event is stored with a timestamp and optional narration.
3. AI Vision Layer
•	Uses computer vision (OpenCV, Mediapipe, OCR) to interpret the current screen and verify that the trainee is in the correct context.
•	Supports:
o	Element matching (e.g., detecting “Save” buttons visually)
o	Text recognition (via OCR)
o	UI validation (e.g., “You clicked the wrong field”)
4. Control Arbitration System
•	Detects when a human interacts (keyboard/mouse input).
•	Immediately pauses AI tutor playback.
•	Waits for user to finish, then resumes automatically.
•	Prevents control conflicts by managing a shared state between human and AI input devices.
5. AI Feedback Engine
•	Compares trainee actions with the recorded “ideal” sequence.
•	Generates feedback:
o	Deviations and corrections
o	Time per step
o	Accuracy percentage
o	Observations (“You skipped step 4: Formatting”)
•	Can export feedback in PDF or JSON for LMS integration.
6. Dialogue Engine
•	Uses an embedded LLM to provide real-time guidance, tips, and explanations.
•	Examples:
o	“Now click on the ‘Insert’ tab at the top.”
o	“Good job — that’s exactly right.”
o	“Try selecting the cell before applying the formula.”
•	Supports both text and optional speech synthesis.

🧭 Example Flow
Tutor Creation
1.	AI or human performs a session while recording.
2.	All actions and visuals are captured.
3.	The session is saved as a .llai file (LiveLearn AI session file).
Trainee Interaction
1.	Trainee opens the session file.
2.	AI begins playback (visible cursor, typing, etc.).
3.	User can take over anytime.
4.	AI pauses and observes until the user stops.
5.	When idle, AI resumes the tutorial.
6.	Feedback is generated automatically.
Output Example
Session Summary:
- Total Steps: 24
- Completed: 21
- Missed: 3
- Accuracy: 87.5%
- Notes:
  - Step 7: Missed ‘Format Cell’ dialog
  - Step 18: Clicked wrong field (‘C5’ instead of ‘B5’)
________________________________________
🔬 Key Innovation
Unlike traditional screen recorders or sandbox tutorials, LiveLearn AI is built to operate natively on the real software — no simulation, no mock UI.
It sees the same screen, moves the same cursor, and interacts with the same system — creating training that’s as real as the software itself.
This means it can teach:
•	Microsoft Excel
•	AutoCAD / SolidWorks
•	SCADA or PLC HMIs
•	ERP / CRM systems
•	Custom internal applications
•	Even browser-based tools (Playwright-compatible)
All from one unified platform.

________________________________________
Would you like me to add an illustrated architecture diagram (ASCII or SVG format) and a sample pseudocode snippet showing how AI and user arbitration would work in a session (e.g., if user_input_detected(): pause_ai() logic)?
That’ll make the README far more compelling to developers scanning the repo.
